Hi, I’m **Natanael Bimo Priambodo**, an Electrical Engineering fresh graduate from **Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM)**.

My work focuses on **full-stack hardware development**, covering **electronic system design, embedded firmware, and system validation**, with strong experience in:

- **Electric powertrain and energy-efficiency vehicle systems**
- **Automotive CAN networks and distributed control**
- **STM32 / ESP32 firmware development**
- **PCB design, sensor interfacing, and test-driven debugging**
- **Power system analysis and techno-economic studies**

---

## **Featured Projects**
### **1) CAN-based Networked Control System for Electric Utility Vehicle (Thesis)**
- Designed a **distributed vehicle control** system using a **CAN Bus architecture (SAE J1939-inspired)**
- Built a custom **STM32-based Main Control Unit**
- Developed and validated an **MCP2515 CAN interface library**, including latency measurement under bus load

### **2) Concrete Cutting Depth Measuring Tool for Toll Roads (UGM x Industry)**
- Designed **power distribution and sensor interface PCB**
- Implemented firmware filtering to stabilize readings on uneven surfaces
- Integrated electronics into a field-ready enclosure with mechanical teams

### **3) IoT-Based Safety Monitoring System (Capstone)**
- Developed an OHS monitoring system integrating **gas sensors + tracking modules**
- Designed the **PCB + enclosure** for harsh waste facility environments
- Built firmware for **real-time acquisition and wireless transmission**
